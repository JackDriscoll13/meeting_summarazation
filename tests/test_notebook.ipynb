      "That pretty decent meeting summary, right?\n",
      "Shockingly good. Yeah.\n",
      "Like, into chat chat or something.\n",
      "Yeah, I'll share with you. We did that. We tested this out on the.\n",

      "It worked for really well and so now.\n",
      "And I'm super excited about it. Wow.\n",
      "Yeah, okay.\n",
      "I mean, you still have to go back through and do a little editing or whatever, but you would have to do that. Even if you were taking super detailed notes at the same time. So.\n",
      "Very cool. Yeah.\n",
      "Well, do we want to start with, um, Julie? I don't know if you have any.\n",
      "Updates beyond what John wells has been sending out this morning on the upgrade and impact on that. Do you have anything else?\n",
      "Um, I do have a little bit of an update on the Apple issue. Um, we, we had a call with Hi this morning.\n",
      "Where he walked us through his proposed fixed.\n",
      "Um, they're still working on it, um, but they, they believe they have a solution. It's not without, uh, some.\n",
      "Uh, errors, um, but I think the bulk of the viewership can be restored, but there, he was walking us through John wells and I, through, um, some graphs that showed.\n",
      "Um, you know, in about 80% of cases.\n",
      "Uh, the appropriate network can be mapped to, uh, to the viewership or the, the viewership for the appropriate network and get extracted. However, in about 20% of the cases, um, they. they\n",
      "Are not able to follow so they know that the customer, for example, is starting with spectrum news, but they cannot see what happens afterwards. And so, uh, the question was.\n",
      "Uh, what do we want to do with that data? Do we just, uh, not assign a network and program to it but just put it in some, um, bucket.\n",
      "Of usage where, you know, for us overall, we will know that.\n",
      "Viewership happened somewhere, but we wouldn't be able to attribute it to a particular network and so.\n",
      "We decided that, you know, for spectrum news, and for all the rest of the networks, uh, in those instances, we should just put it in all other usage bucket.\n",
      "So, um, every network's viewership will be slightly understated. Um, but not not by.\n",
      "20% by, you know, maybe by.\n",
      "You know, 5 to 10%, uh, but at least we'll get the bulk of the data back end. So, I don't think for you guys given that, it's just Apple TV data. I don't think it's gonna be dramatically.\n",
      "You know, dramatically will impact, um, any trending given that we'll probably have about 90% of viewership back in.\n",
      "So, okay, so then, that yeah, do they have a sense of was it con, the, the 20% of.\n",
      "Accounts that they can't correctly map. Is that kind of spread out across.\n",
      "Geographies customer types. Yeah. Yeah. It seems it seemed like it was spread out.\n",
      "Across across apps.\n",
      "So, for spectrum for SDA, and for, I didn't, I didn't ask about.\n",
      "That's a good point. I didn't ask about geographies.\n",
      "Um, so, let me, uh, let me ping him and see if he can look at it. Uh.\n",
      "By geography by market to see if there is any patterns there.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "But that's the only update I have, I don't know, gave, em, if you have anything.\n",
      "Mm, hmm while you've seen the upgrade 1 through over this weekend.\n",
      "So, now I will be working and reloading the March, uh, data aggregate. They didn't get to do it before the gate. So.\n",
      "There are time to do February and then I'm working on March so will soon have the engagement numbers for March 2023.\n",
      "You've been looking at the February data, and it's been reloaded at all.\n",
      "I haven't yet. No, I was planning to do it today.\n",
      "You've seen something that's off, uh.\n",
      "Not necessarily off, um.\n",
      "That is what we are looking at earlier right? Ryan.\n",
      "Which 1, are you referring to.\n",
      "The share.\n",
      "Uh, and the Android device data.\n",
      "Uh, well, I don't think that was particular to February, so.\n",
      "We yeah, we pull the topics. Sorry.\n",
      "Um, pulled.\n",
      "The share viewership coming from set top box and then our apps.\n",
      "And with whatever data fixes happen, and it seems to have.\n",
      "Significantly changed those from what we had as a.\n",
      "As recently a couple of months ago, I think.\n",
      "Um, so now, FDA is like, 32, almost of all of our viewership.\n",
      "Or set top boxes 68.\n",
      "Does that surprise you at all Jim and Julia?\n",
      "We had that number somewhere.\n",
      "But it went from from the teams to 38%.\n",
      "42, um.\n",
      "Q, and what was the, what was the latest percent you had on hand?\n",
      "You 1st shared with me uh, it was 24%.\n",
      "But from an older dataset that we had pulled, I'm guessing in March.\n",
      "Yeah, oh, yeah, I see it on the thread now. So from March earlier this year that we had pulled 26%.\n",
      "3, 6%.\n",
      "Hold on, it seems high to.\n",
      "I have open somewhere.\n",
      "So overall.\n",
      "Across all networks set, top boxes. 83% is.\n",
      "17%, and you're saying you saying specifically is.\n",
      "30, uh, 32% of what.\n",
      "All of our video new households. Oh, yeah. Is that households are viewing ours?\n",
      "Oh, if possible, I, I believe it. Yeah, no uh, not not usage right? Households.\n",
      "And we can pull the usage, we can pull like, station hours.\n",
      "If you can pull usage, uh, that would be.\n",
      "Uh, easier to compare. Okay.\n",
      "The latest number I found in 1 of the decks I heard was August 2022. I had usage, um, 16.\n",
      "And the rest was set top box it changes a little bit by markets.\n",
      "Like, Florida was most 17%, New York City.\n",
      "9% it should be it should be higher now, probably like 17% or so you weren't you weren't expecting a significant jump from this data.\n",
      "Release I wouldn't expect any job. Like, it's just the.\n",
      "Right. Like oh, wait, wait, wait, we fixed Android.\n",
      "Uh, in this data, right? Right.\n",
      "Um, but that's but the Android issue started.\n",
      "In February, so if you compare it to January.\n",
      "I mean, it should be in line.\n",
      "All right okay. And can you work with Jim? Can you just show them how you pull the data? The exact data you have? Because those numbers are and.\n",
      "I want to get that straight, um.\n",
      "Yeah, we'll pull we'll pull station hours and we'll we'll look at it at.\n",
      "Yeah, Jim, Jim, you have different you, you've created different trending, right?\n",
      "Uh, I think, no, we had 1 is a pie chart when we tracked the launch of the apps where we had, I was coming from set the box I was coming from and I was coming from the up.\n",
      "But then tracking it, but do you have anything more recent than, uh, since the launch of the apps? That would have been a few years ago, right?\n",
      "This 1 was the latest I was August 2022.\n",
      "Right. Um, let's see, you.\n",
      "But either way, I mean, if we pull January data and compare it to.\n",
      "Um, the new restate the data it shouldn't directionally be dramatically different. I don't think.\n",
      "I'm running it right now. I'll probably know now, in a few minutes.\n"
