1 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
Looks really well.

2 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:19.075
Does the recording get sent to all of us or just me do you know how it works? It'll get sent it'll get sent to you and then you can share it, but it also it transcribes everything in real time. So there's Jack.

3 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:25.045
Jack just dump that transcription into 1 of these generative ai tools and it.

4 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.990
That pretty decent meeting summary, right?

5 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.170
Shockingly good. Yeah.

6 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.620
Like, into chat chat or something.

7 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.990
Yeah, I'll share with you. We did that. We tested this out on the.

8 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.090
Michael call a few weeks ago and.

9 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.180
It worked for really well and so now.

10 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.020
And I'm super excited about it. Wow.

11 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.760
Yeah, okay.

12 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:10.470
I mean, you still have to go back through and do a little editing or whatever, but you would have to do that. Even if you were taking super detailed notes at the same time. So.

13 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.220
Very cool. Yeah.

14 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.600
Well, do we want to start with, um, Julie? I don't know if you have any.

15 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:39.510
Updates beyond what John wells has been sending out this morning on the upgrade and impact on that. Do you have anything else?

16 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:47.850
Um, I do have a little bit of an update on the Apple issue. Um, we, we had a call with Hi this morning.

17 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.970
Where he walked us through his proposed fixed.

18 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:05.160
Um, they're still working on it, um, but they, they believe they have a solution. It's not without, uh, some.

19 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:19.050
Uh, errors, um, but I think the bulk of the viewership can be restored, but there, he was walking us through John wells and I, through, um, some graphs that showed.

20 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.100
Um, you know, in about 80% of cases.

21 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:02:23.425 --> 00:02:38.215
Uh, the appropriate network can be mapped to, uh, to the viewership or the, the viewership for the appropriate network and get extracted. However, in about 20% of the cases, um, they. they

22 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:51.180
Are not able to follow so they know that the customer, for example, is starting with spectrum news, but they cannot see what happens afterwards. And so, uh, the question was.

23 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:00.600
Uh, what do we want to do with that data? Do we just, uh, not assign a network and program to it but just put it in some, um, bucket.

24 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.760
Of usage where, you know, for us overall, we will know that.

25 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.720
Viewership happened somewhere, but we wouldn't be able to attribute it to a particular network and so.

26 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:23.695
We decided that, you know, for spectrum news, and for all the rest of the networks, uh, in those instances, we should just put it in all other usage bucket.

27 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:32.695
So, um, every network's viewership will be slightly understated. Um, but not not by.

28 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.790
20% by, you know, maybe by.

29 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:49.560
You know, 5 to 10%, uh, but at least we'll get the bulk of the data back end. So, I don't think for you guys given that, it's just Apple TV data. I don't think it's gonna be dramatically.

30 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:59.160
You know, dramatically will impact, um, any trending given that we'll probably have about 90% of viewership back in.

31 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:07.710
So, okay, so then, that yeah, do they have a sense of was it con, the, the 20% of.

32 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.740
Accounts that they can't correctly map. Is that kind of spread out across.

33 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.800
Geographies customer types. Yeah. Yeah. It seems it seemed like it was spread out.

34 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.920
Across across apps.

35 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.609
So, for spectrum for SDA, and for, I didn't, I didn't ask about.

36 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:04:29.609 --> 00:04:32.609
That's a good point. I didn't ask about geographies.

37 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:40.769
Um, so, let me, uh, let me ping him and see if he can look at it. Uh.

38 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:47.459
By geography by market to see if there is any patterns there.

39 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:04:47.459 --> 00:04:52.229
Okay.

40 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:58.499
But that's the only update I have, I don't know, gave, em, if you have anything.

41 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:04.499
Mm, hmm while you've seen the upgrade 1 through over this weekend.

42 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:14.129
So, now I will be working and reloading the March, uh, data aggregate. They didn't get to do it before the gate. So.

43 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:24.959
There are time to do February and then I'm working on March so will soon have the engagement numbers for March 2023.

44 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:29.189
You've been looking at the February data, and it's been reloaded at all.

45 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:33.779
I haven't yet. No, I was planning to do it today.

46 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:41.729
You've seen something that's off, uh.

47 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:48.089
Not necessarily off, um.

48 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:54.479
That is what we are looking at earlier right? Ryan.

49 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.659
Which 1, are you referring to.

50 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:01.289
The share.

51 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:06.239
Uh, and the Android device data.

52 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:10.049
Uh, well, I don't think that was particular to February, so.

53 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:14.849
We yeah, we pull the topics. Sorry.

54 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.659
Um, pulled.

55 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:24.899
The share viewership coming from set top box and then our apps.

56 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:29.759
And with whatever data fixes happen, and it seems to have.

57 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.829
Significantly changed those from what we had as a.

58 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:37.949
As recently a couple of months ago, I think.

59 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:46.559
Um, so now, FDA is like, 32, almost of all of our viewership.

60 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:51.839
Or set top boxes 68.

61 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:57.539
Does that surprise you at all Jim and Julia?

62 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:01.409
We had that number somewhere.

63 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:06.299
But it went from from the teams to 38%.

64 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:09.869
42, um.

65 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:15.779
Q, and what was the, what was the latest percent you had on hand?

66 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:22.619
You 1st shared with me uh, it was 24%.

67 "Keelan Gallagher" (3329018880)
00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:27.839
But from an older dataset that we had pulled, I'm guessing in March.

68 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:34.619
Yeah, oh, yeah, I see it on the thread now. So from March earlier this year that we had pulled 26%.

69 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:07:34.619 --> 00:07:39.389
3, 6%.

70 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:44.399
Hold on, it seems high to.

71 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:54.449
I have open somewhere.

72 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:59.219
So overall.

73 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:07:59.219 --> 00:08:06.329
Across all networks set, top boxes. 83% is.

74 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:14.759
17%, and you're saying you saying specifically is.

75 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:21.299
30, uh, 32% of what.

76 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:28.109
All of our video new households. Oh, yeah. Is that households are viewing ours?

77 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:08:28.109 --> 00:08:35.579
Oh, if possible, I, I believe it. Yeah, no uh, not not usage right? Households.

78 "Keelan Gallagher" (3329018880)
00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:39.119
And we can pull the usage, we can pull like, station hours.

79 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:44.009
If you can pull usage, uh, that would be.

80 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:47.759
Uh, easier to compare. Okay.

81 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:08:47.759 --> 00:09:00.659
The latest number I found in 1 of the decks I heard was August 2022. I had usage, um, 16.

82 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:07.259
And the rest was set top box it changes a little bit by markets.

83 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:11.819
Like, Florida was most 17%, New York City.

84 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:09:11.819 --> 00:09:24.089
9% it should be it should be higher now, probably like 17% or so you weren't you weren't expecting a significant jump from this data.

85 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:09:24.089 --> 00:09:29.219
Release I wouldn't expect any job. Like, it's just the.

86 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:09:29.219 --> 00:09:33.299
Right. Like oh, wait, wait, wait, we fixed Android.

87 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:09:33.299 --> 00:09:37.979
Uh, in this data, right? Right.

88 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:09:37.979 --> 00:09:44.039
Um, but that's but the Android issue started.

89 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:51.899
In February, so if you compare it to January.

90 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:55.199
I mean, it should be in line.

91 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:09:59.549 --> 00:10:06.809
All right okay. And can you work with Jim? Can you just show them how you pull the data? The exact data you have? Because those numbers are and.

92 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:09.899
I want to get that straight, um.

93 "Keelan Gallagher" (3329018880)
00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:14.909
Yeah, we'll pull we'll pull station hours and we'll we'll look at it at.

94 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:10:14.909 --> 00:10:22.739
Yeah, Jim, Jim, you have different you, you've created different trending, right?

95 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:10:22.739 --> 00:10:37.289
Uh, I think, no, we had 1 is a pie chart when we tracked the launch of the apps where we had, I was coming from set the box I was coming from and I was coming from the up.

96 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:10:37.289 --> 00:10:48.749
But then tracking it, but do you have anything more recent than, uh, since the launch of the apps? That would have been a few years ago, right?

97 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:10:48.749 --> 00:10:53.129
This 1 was the latest I was August 2022.

98 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:10:53.129 --> 00:10:57.719
Right. Um, let's see, you.

99 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:10:57.719 --> 00:11:02.009
But either way, I mean, if we pull January data and compare it to.

100 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:11:02.009 --> 00:11:09.629
Um, the new restate the data it shouldn't directionally be dramatically different. I don't think.

101 "Keelan Gallagher" (3329018880)
00:11:13.859 --> 00:11:16.979
I'm running it right now. I'll probably know now, in a few minutes.

102 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:11:16.979 --> 00:11:28.199
Okay on that topic I wanted to check in to see Julie. I think you said, oh, a little while back you're going to connect with someone on the latest from.

103 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:11:28.199 --> 00:11:35.129
What Katy, Donna and her team, like next steps for power on on.

104 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:40.289
She told me last week.

105 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:11:40.289 --> 00:11:48.389
Uh, that she did not, uh, get anything back from Katie. Uh.

106 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:53.879
Maybe we just need to what, what exactly she is, she investigating.

107 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:57.959
The pylon or the so.

108 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:01.919
From that last time that we all met together, it.

109 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:12:02.634 --> 00:12:16.164
Nathan, and, and step in here too, if there's anything I'm missing here, but the, what I recall is that on Apple TV, we, we need to switch up the rules for, like, what constitutes power on. Right?

110 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:12:16.164 --> 00:12:21.474
Because as it currently stands, you have to close out of the app for it to.

111 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:32.429
And power on to spectrum news. Okay. Um, so it's really about like, redefining what exactly power on means on the connected.

112 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:12:32.429 --> 00:12:36.899
Tv device apps that was specific to Apple TV, right?

113 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:43.619
Yeah, but we should, we should make sure that it's aligned across all the platforms because.

114 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:12:43.619 --> 00:12:52.589
Who knows for the other ones, if there's slight differences that could make a significant impact on the actual.

115 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:12:52.589 --> 00:12:56.609
Amount of times people are saying spectrum is when it comes on.

116 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:12:56.609 --> 00:13:04.019
So, it's basically, if you, if you get out of the app and then come back within a certain period of time.

117 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:13:04.019 --> 00:13:10.649
It doesn't, uh, power on you, uh, unless unless you've been out.

118 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:13:10.649 --> 00:13:25.554
For a certain number of hours, right? I mean, what I recall for Apple TV, I don't think there was an hour limit is like, you could be out of it for a week. And as long as you didn't actually close out of that app manually on the Apple TV.

119 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:30.869
Interface then you're still not going to power on to the spectrum news.

120 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:13:30.869 --> 00:13:39.119
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. I don't know about the week's part, but yeah, like that.

121 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:46.409
Ours could go by and you could do any number of other viewing events on other apps and come back.

122 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:13:46.409 --> 00:13:52.769
To the spectrum news app, or come back to and it would still power on 2.

123 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:13:52.769 --> 00:13:56.549
Go back to what you were watching when you finished your last session.

124 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:13:56.549 --> 00:14:04.589
Because then you wouldn't test with this. Yeah, we tested it pretty extensively with last fall.

125 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:14:04.589 --> 00:14:10.409
She had a whole list of, like, if Dan's that we went through, I can, I can.

126 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:14:10.409 --> 00:14:14.399
Probably surface, at least my responses to that.

127 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:14:14.399 --> 00:14:22.529
And from Katie, WH, uh, what do we need from from Katie the confirmation or the, um.

128 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:34.079
No, I don't think we need confirmation. We just need to know next steps of how we actually change the power on rules. And, like I wonder, I'm not sure if that's.

129 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:14:34.079 --> 00:14:44.159
Do you think that's Katie? I'm not sure. I think it's I think it's we need to go to the product person for Apple TV.

130 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:55.919
And work with them, shouldn't we? Uh, there was somebody, uh, when this whole Apple issue came up, um.

131 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:14:55.919 --> 00:15:04.289
Rocky ping me, and she had somebody on the on the call with her who was the product manager for Apple TV?

132 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:15:04.289 --> 00:15:09.749
Um, I can see if I can get her name.

133 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:15:09.749 --> 00:15:14.279
And maybe maybe we can just talk to her.

134 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:18.869
Okay, how it works.

135 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:15:18.869 --> 00:15:22.859
Get the product person.

136 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:15:22.859 --> 00:15:28.979
Okay, let me let me look into it.

137 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:15:28.979 --> 00:15:41.459
Thanks, Sarah is so busy in her new world. It's like, impossible to get a hold of her. So, let me let me deal with it.

138 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:45.539
Sounds good, thank you. Um.

139 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:15:45.539 --> 00:15:55.409
What else heads up we.

140 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:15:55.409 --> 00:16:05.309
You got confirmation that the power on fix rolled out successfully last week, and they didn't see any notice will increase in call volume to call centers. So, that was good.

141 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:08.699
Um, so we'll.

142 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:20.219
Wait until the viewership data is good to pull. The recent may dealership. Data is good following this city upgrade and.

143 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:16:20.219 --> 00:16:24.059
Then we can validate on our end that we're saying, hopefully.

144 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:16:24.059 --> 00:16:27.659
The impact of the fix perfect.

145 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:16:27.659 --> 00:16:36.449
Sighting yes, and also we were just our team was just meeting before this also exciting knowing that.

146 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:16:36.449 --> 00:16:44.519
Uh, there's definitely didn't fix everything, so hopefully we see a positive impact and then we regroup and figure out. All right what are the gaps.

147 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:47.969
That we still see and get those addressed eventually.

148 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:16:53.099 --> 00:17:02.099
Yeah, 1 of our analysts moved to Florida in the fall and didn't get spec, news is power on and hers was not fixed last week. So.

149 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:17:02.099 --> 00:17:16.289
We know that there are issues post November like this fix was supposed to capture that whatever issues happen between March and November last year. Um, we know that there have been continued issues since November per the data.

150 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:17:16.289 --> 00:17:20.489
That and analysis you all did, and anecdotally.

151 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:17:20.489 --> 00:17:28.139
For example, Mike, a month or so ago, getting his new box in and not coming with spectrum uses power on in New York City.

152 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:17:28.139 --> 00:17:36.959
Um, and then clearly, there's at least 1 person who, even in that period of last year didn't get there is fixed. So.

153 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:17:36.959 --> 00:17:40.499
More to come.

154 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:17:40.499 --> 00:17:53.699
Sounds good Nathan. Anything else on your end.

155 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:17:57.779 --> 00:18:03.389
Nothing from me, How's that query? Coming along?

156 "Keelan Gallagher" (3329018880)
00:18:03.389 --> 00:18:09.839
It's coming as soon as I guess I'll send it to the group if we're not still on the call.

157 "Keelan Gallagher" (3329018880)
00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:15.539
Yeah, I don't think I have.

158 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:21.539
Anything else top of mind.

159 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:28.979
For a moment, we'll probably be reaching out.

160 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:18:28.979 --> 00:18:35.819
You have a bunch this week and next just to make sure that we're seeing the same stuff in the in the reloaded data, but.

161 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:18:35.819 --> 00:18:42.449
As long as you'll be around, we'll look forward to chatting with you and yeah. You know, we're hoping.

162 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:18:42.449 --> 00:18:52.769
To probably send out both March and april's engagement report. By the end of the month. I had initially said.

163 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:18:52.769 --> 00:18:56.939
The 19th, but I don't think that's gonna happen. So if we can get it out by the.

164 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:18:56.939 --> 00:19:01.019
2526 or 31st that'd be great.

165 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:10.379
Yeah, and are you taking any sorry? Are you taking any time off for Memorial day, or you'd be around.

166 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:19:10.379 --> 00:19:14.999
To validate, I'll do it around.

167 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:18.419
Priority number 1.

168 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:26.279
Yeah, uh, Kim would, would you run your type.

169 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:19:26.279 --> 00:19:30.839
Analysis of of the new data yes you can see.

170 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:19:30.839 --> 00:19:37.889
The gaps, yes, that way Jim has created like a tracker. That's.

171 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:19:37.889 --> 00:19:44.039
I mean, it goes, it's it's not spectrum news specific. It's more just overall, um, to kind of.

172 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:19:44.039 --> 00:19:52.439
Uh, uh, and, uh, you know, hopefully some things will pop up.

173 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:19:52.439 --> 00:19:56.909
If, uh, some red flags, we'll, we'll see some red flags if there's.

174 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:19:56.909 --> 00:20:02.129
Any data issue and then reload.

175 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:20:02.129 --> 00:20:10.589
So, I had had John wells load a mapping file that maps line up to spectrum news feed.

176 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:14.519
Region and market in the sandbox, I mean, uh.

177 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:20:14.519 --> 00:20:27.569
Yeah, I'll share that link with you. It's helpful for a lot of our reporting takes out of Excel step for us. So, I mean, hopefully that mapping is current, but.

178 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:20:27.569 --> 00:20:33.359
Andy, I need to have that environment.

179 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:40.019
Nice and we're starting to see more and more relating to spectrum .

180 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:20:40.019 --> 00:20:54.149
So, we got keeping track of it for now, but you let us know how you want to report on it because we'll be able to add later on similar to how we do for spectrum use and Tableau. If you want to look at monthly.

181 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:58.709
It'd be good to know. Yeah. I don't know.

182 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:20:58.709 --> 00:21:02.639
Yeah, I haven't I haven't personally, I thought.

183 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:21:02.639 --> 00:21:07.439
I thought too deeply on what those reports might look like Ryan. I don't know if you have.

184 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:21:07.439 --> 00:21:11.339
Thoughts on that for plans.

185 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:21:11.339 --> 00:21:17.939
No, not yet. Not yet. Cool.

186 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:21:17.939 --> 00:21:32.579
Tbd, and with the apps, so the last quarter we had done by bundled so that we get more or less the same numbers. And what has.

187 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:21:32.579 --> 00:21:35.969
In order to know the product bundle of the app.

188 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:21:35.969 --> 00:21:47.279
So, we also keep updating that to see if there's a significant change for users or mobile app users, but we can.

189 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:21:47.279 --> 00:21:54.539
At least on the relative bases and index values, we could report on it. If you want it.

190 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:21:57.809 --> 00:22:10.919
Is that sell for spectrum news plus? Or is this so India you have your ship for both that we see coming through the spectrum use local feed and then the spectrum use plus feed.

191 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:22:10.919 --> 00:22:22.199
But also, among our users authenticated users that are customers of charter over, we do the product bundle information as a customer to got it.

192 "Guillaume Schwengler" (489824000)
00:22:22.199 --> 00:22:26.219
Got it cool.

193 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:22:36.089 --> 00:22:40.349
Anything else I can walk on with Michael likes to say.

194 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:22:40.349 --> 00:22:46.139
For that John Mike, I think.

195 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:22:46.139 --> 00:22:49.319
Yeah, we're good. Love that.

196 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:22:49.319 --> 00:22:55.739
Cool. Cool. Thanks guys. Well, hopefully, no data issues.

197 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:22:55.739 --> 00:23:00.299
Fingers crossed. Yeah. It seems like it's going well so far. So.

198 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:23:00.299 --> 00:23:05.639
I was happy to see that the upgrade went through smoothly this morning. Everything was back up on line.

199 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:23:05.639 --> 00:23:11.189
Kim actually said that the DB seemed to be performing pretty well this morning. So.

200 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:23:11.189 --> 00:23:14.369
I love that.

201 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:23:14.369 --> 00:23:19.049
That'd be nice if there is, there was a side effect.

202 "Nathan Hess" (711442944)
00:23:19.049 --> 00:23:26.609
Yeah, right yeah cleared out all the old zombie jobs.

203 "Julya Fridman" (1072131584)
00:23:26.609 --> 00:23:29.699
All right cool. Talk to you guys soon.

204 "Ryan Richards" (4172936192)
00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:33.900
Hi guys bye.
